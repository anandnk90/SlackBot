Python is named after 'Monty Python and the flying circus', a popular show from the 70s
Python does not support pointers
Python uses dynamic typing and a mix of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:Beautiful is better than ugly;Explicit is better than implicit;Simple is better than complex;Complex is better than complicated;Readability counts
Rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the language's core, Python was designed to be highly extensible
Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonists, Pythonistas, and Pythoneers
